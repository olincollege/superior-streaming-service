To achieve this we will use two functions.The `fetch_and_write_title_ids_to_file` which writes data on files.It calls the `fetch_list_title_data` function which then makes a call to the watchmode API service.Once we get the data, we then store the data in files using the `fetch_and_write_title_ids_to_file` function. The `fetch_and_write_title_ids_to_file` takes in one paremeter which is the id of the streaming source.In this case 243 is the id of Netflix streaming service on the watchmode api"

With that in mind, we need to interate over the five files, get the title id, and then use the  Watchmode `Title` API to get the details of the title.

In the following code block, we created a function `get_genre_ratings`that will return the average rating for a specific genre within a specific streaming service.
