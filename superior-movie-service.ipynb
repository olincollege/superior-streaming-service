    "Our first step will be fetching movie ids from various streaming services and storing the data in text files.We will get movies ids from 5 major services(Netflix,HBO,Amazon,Hulu,Disney plus).By the end of this step we will have 5 files, each having movies from all the 5 mentioned streaming services. To achieve this we will use two functions.The `fetch_and_write_title_ids_to_file` which writes data on files.It calls the `fetch_list_title_data` function which then makes a call to the watchmode API service.Once we get the data, we then store the data in files using the `fetch_and_write_title_ids_to_file` function. The `fetch_and_write_title_ids_to_file` takes in one paremeter which is the id of the streaming source.In this case 243 is the id of Netflix streaming service on the watchmode api"
